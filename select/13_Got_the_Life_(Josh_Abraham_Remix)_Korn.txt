Hate, something, sometime, someway
Something kicked off the front for me
Something inside (I'll never ever follow)
So give me something that is for real
(I'll never ever follow)
Get your boogie on
Get your boogie on
Hate, something, somewhere, each day
Feeling ripped off and given away
This shit inside (now everyone will follow)
So give me nothing, just feel
(And now this shit will follow)
God paged me, "You'll never see the light", who wants to see?
God told me, "I've already got the life", oh, I say
God paged me, "You'll never see the light", who wants to see?
And God told me, "I've already got the life", oh, I say
Each day I can feel it swallow
Inside something they took from me
I don't wanna feel your deathly ways
Each day I feel so hollow
Inside I was beating me
You will never see, so come dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
(Me)
God paged me, "You'll never see the light", who wants to see?
God told me, "I've already got the life", oh, I say
God paged me, "You'll never see the light", who wants to see?
And God told me, "I've already got the life"
Got the life, got the life
Got the life, got the life
Got the life, got the life
Got the life, got the life
Got the life
