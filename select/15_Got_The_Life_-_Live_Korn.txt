I think this is the most talking I've ever done in my whole career
We're gonna play "Got the Life"

Hate, something, sometime, someway
Something kick off the front floor
Mine, something inside
I'll never ever follow
So give me something that is for real
I'll never ever follow

Get your boogie on
Get your boogie on

Hate, something, sometime, someway
Feeling ripped off again, now
Why, this shit inside
Now everyone will follow
So give me nothing, just feel
And now this will follow

God paged me
You'll never see the light
Who wants to see?
God told me
I've already got the life
Oh, I say

God paged me
You'll never see the light
Who wants to see?
God told me
I've already got the life
Oh, I say

Each day, I can feel it swallow
Inside always beating me
I don't wanna feel your deathly ways
Each day I feel so hollow
Inside I was beating me
You will never see
So come dance with me

Dance with me
Dance with me, me!

God paged me
You'll never see the light
Who wants to see?
God told me
I've already got the life
Oh, I say

God paged me
You'll never see the light
Who wants to see?
God told me
I've already got the life

Got the life, got the life, got the life
Got the life, got the life, got the life
Got the life, got the life, got the life
