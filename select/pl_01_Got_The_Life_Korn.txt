Hate, something
sometime someway
something kick
off the floor for
Mine? Something, inside
I'll never ever follow
So give me some thing
that is for real
I'll never ever follow
Get your boogie on
Hate, something, someway
each day, dealing with no
forgiveness
Why? This shit inside
Now everyone will follow
So give me nothing
just feel
And now this shit will follow
God paged me
you'll never see the lie
who wants to see?
God told me
I've already got the life
oh I say
God paged me
you'll never see the lie
who wants to see?
God told me
I've already got the life
oh I say
<♪>
Each day
I can feel it swallow
inside something they
took from me
I don't feel your deathly ways
Each day I feel so hollow
inside I was beating me
You will never see
so come dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Rumbiddieboo
God paged me
you'll never see the lie
who wants to see?
God told me
I've already got the life
oh I say
God paged me
you'll never see the lie
who wants to see?
God told me
I've already got the life
Got the life
Got the life
Got the life
